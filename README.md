# Hello-World
It is here to find a way
Well, it seems to be quite a comfortable place.
Let's go with the guide and explain my capabilities.
Basically I am a student who learned a bit here and there, so I know a bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, C++ and so on.
I am not really that proficient, but well, gotta practice to get there.
I know two languages Russian (native speaker) and English.
